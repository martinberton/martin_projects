                <b>Overview:</b><br>
                SDLC, Software Development Life Cycle is a process used by software industry to design, develop and test high quality softwares. 
                The SDLC aims to produce a high quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates.

                    <li>SDLC is the acronym of Software Development Life Cycle.</li>
                    <li>It is also called as Software development process. </li>
                    <li>The software development life cycle (SDLC) is a framework defining tasks performed at each step in the software development process. </li>
                    <li>ISO/IEC 12207 is an international standard for software life-cycle processes. It aims to be the standard that defines all the tasks required for developing and maintaining software. </li>

                <b>What is SDLC?</b><br>
                SDLC is a process followed for a software project, within a software organization.
                It consists of a detailed plan describing how to develop, maintain, replace and alter or enhance specific software.
                The life cycle defines a methodology for improving the quality of software and the overall development process.
